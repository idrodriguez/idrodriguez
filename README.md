## Hello! I'm IvÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez ðŸ‘‹

I'm an IT Geek that likes everything related to software and technology topics. I love open source and free software philosophy, and I became a GNU/Linux user in the 90's starting with Slackware->Redhat->Ubuntu->Debian-> and finally, the loved ArchLinux + i3. I love sharing and teaching. 

I love reading, and I think some of these books impact how you work and what you are doing. That's why I'm now sharing some recommendations related to software development:
