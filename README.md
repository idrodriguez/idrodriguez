## Hello! I'm Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez üëã

I'm an IT Geek that likes everything related to software and technology topics. I love open source and free software philosophy, and I became a GNU/Linux user in the 90's starting with Slackware->Redhat->Ubuntu->Debian-> and finally, the loved ArchLinux + i3. I love sharing and teaching. 


### My Calibre Library:

I love reading, and I think some of this book impacts how you are working and what you are doing. That's why I'm sharing now my calibre library.
